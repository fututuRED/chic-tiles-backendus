      "description": "<p>Piet Mondrian, a painter of the revolutionary international movement De Stijl (the Style), argued that \"the straight line tells the truth.\" Why, then, we might wonder, would he choose to hang a painting off axis, where its edges imply dynamic diagonals? Among other motivations, rotating the canvas allowed Mondrian to reconsider a question he spent his career exploring, namely, the relationship between the contents of a painting and what contains them. In <em>Lozenge Composition</em>, the squared-off black lines imply enclosure, while a single line (above the blue area) extends to the slanted edge, suggesting extension beyond the canvas. This implication of what might lie beyond also prompted Mondrian to invoke the full expanse of the wall by hanging diagonal paintings well above eye level.</p>\n",

Concurrent with his classroom interaction with student weavers, Klee began to use increasingly unusual fabrics in his paintings, including cotton, jute, and silk, to explore the interaction between paint and the many distinct textures of his supports. In late works such as <em>Exotics</em>, painted on coarse burlap, Klee recalled his formative journeys to Tunisia and Egypt in 1914 and 1928, respectively. While these trips to North Africa, then under occupation by France and Great Britain, originally positioned him as an adventurer in the eyes of his contemporaries, the rough-hewn, woven character of the painting’s support was an expression of his long-standing interest in weaving.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Paul Klee was an artist and teacher at the Bauhaus for most of that famed school’s existence. Initially head of the bookbinding department, Klee made his greatest contribution as a lecturer on the theory of form in art for the basic design course. There, he developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting—the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces “a transformed beholder of art.”</p>\n<p>Klee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like <em>Sunset</em> reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition—balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth—relates to Klee’s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that “does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.”</p>\n",

Pollock emphasized the expressive power of the artist’s gestures, materials, and tools, often applying paint with sticks, trowels, and palette knives instead of brushes. He also challenged the concept of easel painting by working on canvases placed either on the floor or fixed to a wall. With no apparent beginning or end, top or bottom, his paintings imply an extension of his art beyond the edges of the canvas, engulfing the viewer. Among the last great purely abstract paintings Pollock made before his untimely death in 1956, <em>Greyed Rainbow</em> is a quintessential example of action painting. The paint application ranges from thick chunks squeezed directly from a tube to thin, meandering lines poured from a container with a small hole or squirted from a baster. The work is predominantly black, white, gray, and silver; in the bottom third of the canvas, however, Pollock thinly concealed orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The title of the work presumably refers to these grayed sections of hidden color.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O’Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work culminates a series inspired by the artist’s experiences as an airplane passenger during the 1950s. Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O’Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O’Keeffe wrote:</p>\n<p>&quot;I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide—it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold—I worked in the garage and it had no heat—Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years.&quot;</p>\n<p>In 1970 <em>Sky above Clouds IV</em> was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O’Keeffe’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum’s permanent collection.</p>\n<p>The special relationship between O’Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O’Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art. She continued to make significant additions to this bequest until her death, at age 98, in 1986.</p>\n",

Exiled to Switzerland, Klee suffered physically and psychologically, and his artistic output diminished significantly. Between 1937 and 1940, however, Klee regained artistic momentum and produced several hundred paintings and over 1,500 drawings. In these later works, Klee continued to experiment with unusual media and techniques to produce multidimensional effects. <em>Dancing Girl</em> also reveals Klee’s limitless humor—his signature at the lower right was made by a monogrammed handkerchief, which he laid over the surface to begin his painting.</p>\n",

The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert.” O’Keeffe’s inclusion of the calico fabric roses—which were used to decorate graves in New Mexico—further evokes questions of life, death, and mortality.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>In his 1912 book <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em>, Vasily Kandinsky made an analogy between music and painting as two means of abstraction, a radical mode of artmaking that freed color and line from their traditionally representational functions. Between 1910 and 1914 he produced “improvisations,” works he described as unconscious, spontaneous expressions. Kandinsky commented on <em>Improvisation No. 30 (Cannons)</em> in a letter to Arthur Jerome Eddy, a friend and collector from Chicago: “The cannons . . . could probably be explained by the constant war talk going on through the year [but] the true contents are what the spectator experiences while under the effect of the forms and color combinations of the picture.”</p>\n",
      "short_description": "In his 1912 book <em>Concerning the Spiritual in Art</em>, Vasily Kandinsky advocated for an art that could move beyond imitation of the physical world, inspiring, as he put it, “vibrations in the soul.” Between 1910 and 1914 he produced a series of “improvisations,\" which he described as unconscious, spontaneous expressions. This painting—one of his first improvisations—is a standout work within the museum's modern art collection.",

While living in Europe between 1948 and 1954, the artist encountered winged altarpieces in churches and cathedrals, which sparked his interest in works composed of separate pieces. He began arranging the colors of his paintings using chance techniques, removing himself from decisions that would influence the aesthetic of the finished artwork. Rather than use handmade marks in this piece, Kelly relied on intersecting edges and flat planes of monochrome color to express form.</p>\n",

He made this seven-panel painting as he was beginning to uncover the nearly infinite possibilities of monochrome, color spectrum, chance ordering, and multipanel composition. It is among the artist’s finest and most influential early statements on canvas",

Twombly’s entire enterprise is characterized by unruly marks—stammering, energetic, and raw—that merge drawing, painting, writing, and symbolic glyphs. Scrawled, overwritten, erased, or willfully misspelled, words cite people, places, events, and stories nominally derived from Greco-Roman culture and history, especially literature, poetry, and myth.</p>\n",

Portraying the grandeur of the American landscape, the artist omitted the factories, scenic overlooks, and hotels that populated the area in the early 19th century. Cole expressed concern about the environmental impact of voracious industrialism, but at the same time his painting erased the human devastation wrought by colonialism and conquest in the region, which encompassed Attiwonderonk, Haudenosaunee, and Wenrohronon lands. The two Native American figures at center, combined with the falls, identify the setting as North America, but their diminished presence in scale and number reinforces the false idea of the “vanishing Indian” and is meant to signal impending transformation rather than acknowledge their stolen sovereignty.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>After decades as a representational painter, in her seventies Alma Thomas turned to abstraction, creating shimmering, mosaic-like fields of color with rhythmic dabs of paint that were often inspired by forms from nature. The artist had been fascinated with space exploration since the late 1960s, and her later paintings often referenced America’s manned Apollo missions to the moon. Although she had never flown, Thomas began to paint as if she were in an airplane, capturing what she described as shifting patterns of light and streaks of color. “You look down on things,” she explained. “You streak through the clouds so fast. . . . You see only streaks of color.”</p>\n<p><em>Starry Night and the Astronauts</em> evokes the open expanse and celestial patterns of a night sky, but despite its narrative title, the work could also be read as an aerial view of a watery surface, playing with our sense of immersion within an otherwise flat picture plane. The viewer is immersed not only in the sense of organic expanse that this painting achieves, however, but also in an encounter with Thomas’s process: the surface here is clearly constructed stroke by stroke. Meanwhile, the glimpses of raw canvas between each primary-colored mark seem as vivid as the applied paint itself—almost as if the composition were backlit. Thomas relied on the enlivening properties of color throughout her late-blooming career. “Color is life,” she once proclaimed, “and light is the mother of color.” This painting was created in 1972, when the artist was eighty. In the same year, she became the first African American woman to receive a solo exhibition at a major art museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Cy Twombly is best known for a synthesis of drawing, painting, and writing that balances abstract with suggestively pictorial impulses. His inimitable scribbles and scrawls are at once intuitive and sublime, casual or even crude and refined. Twombly made the dynamic, brooding <em>Untitled</em> as one in a suite of fourteen large-scale paintings during the summer of 1969 while ensconced at Palazzo del Drago on the shores of Lake Bolsena in central Italy. Against a rich, creamy ground, he elaborated on the cascades of planar and tubular shapes that had emerged in his painting the year before, using diagram-like forms to imbue the canvas with a sense of spatiotemporal flow, as well as a certain airiness. On the other hand, the white field—darkened here and there by passages of erasure—also takes on the aspect of a heavily revised mathematical worksheet. Twombly was immersed both in his work and in his particular location, titling these paintings with the place-name Bolsena. But while typically he might find inspiration in the history of his ancient rural retreat, in this case he was as attuned to that summer’s defining moment: the <em>Apollo II</em> moon landing. Such context enhances our reading of the painting’s enigmatic visual language of measurement, drift, and direction.</p>\n",
